## Overview

This package gives you the ability to apply an aggregative or summarizing function to successive equi-length subsequences of some larger data sequence.

As an example, consider a sequence of temperatures taken each day at noon during a leap year. This gives us a vector `vec` of 366 values, indexed 1:366.
